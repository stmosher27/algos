# Dynamic Programming practice
# NB: you can, if you want, define helper functions to create the necessary caches as instance variables in the constructor.
# You may find it helpful to delegate the dynamic programming work itself to a helper method so that you can
# then clean out the caches you use.  You can also change the inputs to include a cache that you pass from call to call.

    # Use this to create any instance variables you may need

  # Takes in a positive integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number
  # Should run in O(n) time

  # Make Change: write a function that takes in an amount and a set of coins.  Return the minimum number of coins
  # needed to make change for the given amount.  You may assume you have an unlimited supply of each type of coin.
  # If it's not possible to make change for a given amount, return nil.  You may assume that the coin array is sorted
  # and in ascending order.
  def make_change(amt, coins, coin_cache = {0 => 0})

  # Knapsack Problem: write a function that takes in an array of weights, an array of values, and a weight capacity
  # and returns the maximum value possible given the weight constraint.  For example: if weights = [1, 2, 3],
  # values = [10, 4, 8], and capacity = 3, your function should return 10 + 4 = 14, as the best possible set of items
  # to include are items 0 and 1, whose values are 10 and 4 respectively.  Duplicates are not allowed -- that is, you
  # can only include a particular item once.
  def knapsack(weights, values, capacity)
  end

  # Stair Climber: a frog climbs a set of stairs.  It can jump 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps at a time.
  # Write a function that returns all the possible ways the frog can get from the bottom step to step n.
  # For example, with 3 steps, your function should return [[1, 1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1], [3]].
  # NB: this is similar to, but not the same as, make_change.  Try implementing this using the opposite
  # DP technique that you used in make_change -- bottom up if you used top down and vice versa.
  def stair_climb(n)
  end

  # String Distance: given two strings, str1 and str2, calculate the minimum number of operations to change str1 into
  # str2.  Allowed operations are deleting a character ("abc" -> "ac", e.g.), inserting a character ("abc" -> "abac", e.g.),
  # and changing a single character into another ("abc" -> "abz", e.g.).
  def str_distance(str1, str2)
  end

  # Maze Traversal: write a function that takes in a maze (represented as a 2D matrix) and a starting
  # position (represented as a 2-dimensional array) and returns the minimum number of steps needed to reach the edge of the maze (including the start).
  # Empty spots in the maze are represented with ' ', walls with 'x'. For example, if the maze input is:
  #            [['x', 'x', 'x', 'x'],
  #             ['x', ' ', ' ', 'x'],
  #             ['x', 'x', ' ', 'x']]
  # and the start is [1, 1], then the shortest escape route is [[1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2]] and thus your function should return 3.
